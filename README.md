# goblin radio tower

Run your own internet radio station, similar to [Icecast](https://icecast.org). It was originally used to make [2 Warcraft 2 Radio](https://2-warcraft-2-radio.glitch.me).

## usage

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out all the values
2. Run `npm start` in your terminal to fire up the server
3. Use the `Admin` link in the navigation to log in with your username and password that you set in step 1
4. Use the options on the Admin page to upload or delete files (they're stored in the `static/tracks/` folder if you wanna do this manually)
5. Share the `/stream` URL (shown on the index page) with your friends!
